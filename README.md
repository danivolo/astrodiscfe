# The Finite Element Method applied to astrophysical disc evolution

In this project for my PDE exam I try to approximate the solution of a parabolic advection-diffusion equation with non-costant coefficients with the Galerkin FEM method in space and the Crank-Nicolson method in time.

The equation describes the viscous evolution of thin axisymmetric accretion discs, as firstly described by Lynden-Bell and Pringle in 1974.
